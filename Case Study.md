After living in the surburbs for 4 years, my husband and I have decided to move to central west London. Hence I would like to use this opportunity to explore the area on OpendStreetMap.




## Problems Encountered in the Map
After downloading the data set for central west London, I had a quick scan through of a small segment of data. It is noted immediately, some of the street names seem to be out of the ordinary.  After running a provisional python file, the following problems were noted:

- Inconsistent case and typo in street names
- Over-abbreviated street names 
- Inconsistent abbreviation for "Saint"
- Irrelevent postcodes
- Inappropriate apostrophes within address
- Addresses with double postcodes


### Problems with street names
A list of expected street names, such as "Street" and "Road", is created. A regular expression is used to identify different types of street names within our data set. Any street names matching an item within the expected lists are not investigated further.  

After running the `audit` function (see below), we noted there are a few issues with the street names.
```python
def audit(osmfile):
    osm_file = open(osmfile, "r")
    street_types = defaultdict(set)
    for event, elem in ET.iterparse(osm_file, events=("start",)):

        if elem.tag == "node" or elem.tag == "way":
            for tag in elem.iter("tag"):
                if is_street_name(tag):
                    audit_street_type(street_types, tag.attrib['v'])
```

#### Inconsistent case and typo in street name
Some street names are written in lower cases *("street")*. A few obvious typos also noted among street names, such as "Wqalk" and "Strreet".

#### Over abbreviation
A common example for this particular issue is showing "St" rather than "Street".

#### Inconsistent abbreviation for "Saint"
The word "Saint" is very common among street names within UK. It is usually displayed as an abbreviated version of "St". Two other versions also appeared within the data set, "Saint" and "St." *("Saint Alban's Grove" and "St Alban's Grove")*

In order to eliminate the above three issues, an `update_name` function is used:
```python
def update_name(name, mapping):
    name = string.capwords(name) 
    m = street_type_re.search(name)
    if m:
        street_type = m.group()
        if street_type not in expected and street_type in mapping:
            name = re.sub(street_type_re, mapping[street_type], name)
    else:
        print "Strange street name: " % name #print any strange street name does not match the regular expression

    if "Saint " in name or "St. " in name: 
        name = name.replace("Saint ", "St ")
        name = name.replace("St. ", "St ")
    return name
```

This updated all the street names so that they all start with a capital letter. Typos noted were fixed using a list of mapping. Different versions of "Saint" are all converted to "St" in the data set.

#### Inappropriate use of apostrophes
Apart from the issues noted above, it is also noted that some street names have inappropriate use of apostrophes. *(Princes Gardens", "Prince's Gardens" and "Princes's Gardens")*. Due to limited local knowledge and time comsuing nature of finding all the correct version of those street names containing apostrophes, these street names are left unfixed in the data set.


### Problems with postcodes
A similar approach is taken to identify problems with postcode. Firstly, regular expression is used to identify postcodes under "way" and "node". Subsequently, the following function is used to identify postcodes.

```python
def find_postcode():
    osm_file = open(cw_london, "r")
    postcode_types = set()
    odd_postcode = set()
    for event, elem in ET.iterparse(osm_file, events=("start",)):

        if elem.tag == "node" or elem.tag == "way":
            for tag in elem.iter("tag"):
                if is_postcode(tag):
                    m = postcode_re.search(tag.attrib['v'])
                    if m:
                        postcode_types.add(tag.attrib['v'])  
                    else:
                        odd_postcode.add(tag.attrib['v'])

    osm_file.close()

    return (postcode_types, odd_postcode)
```

After investigating the result, we noted two major problems with the postcpde. Area postcodes appears among postcode which is the post code for the entire are rather than a specific address *("SW6")*. In addition to are postcodes, we noted afew addres have two postcode *("W2 1NE;W2 1NF")*. In London, there are a few address containing two postcodes and both of them are correct. 

To fix the problems with postcode, the following function was written:
```python
def update_postcode(odd_postcode):
    if area_postcode_re.search(odd_postcode):
        postcode = " "
    else:
        postcode = odd_postcode.split(";")[0]
    return postcode
```

Area post codes are dropped from the data set and the first postcode is kept if two postcodes were identified for the same address. "W2 1NE;W2 1NF" is changed to "W2 1NE".

## Additional Ideas
During data cleansing process, it is noted that there are cases where inappropriate aprostrophes were identified. Likewise, there are also street names that are extremely similar *(eg. "Snowfields" and "Snowsfields")*. They are not fixed within the this project due to insufficient local knowledge as well as the time consuming nature of this task.

One possible solution, is to standardise these street names in during the data wrangling proces. This is a fast solution to the problem but the accuracy of the street name is comprimised.

An alternative method is to use machine learning identifying potential duplication of street names based on certain degree of similarity. Subsequently, carry out research to find out the accurate name for a particular street.
